# Introduction
### Project Title
Responsive Shopping Website

### Description
This project is made to demonstrate a slider effect of jQuery lightslider. Slider can be best used in the showcase of fashion campaign, digital art gallery, movie posters and items featuring visuals and graphics. The way to make a showcase slider by lightslider is pretty simple, but the way to achieve responsive design is more difficult and complicated. In addition to media query in css, matchMedia-a JavaScript method to detect the screen width-is also used to fit nav bar and menu in different screen size.
